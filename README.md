# Time React

## To do

Create a 5 minute countdown timer that can be started and stopped.

## Behaviours

When the page is first loaded, the counter displays 5 minutes (i.e. 5:00)
When the user clicks "Start", the counter starts counting down.
When the user clicks "Stop", the timer should stop elapsing time.
When the user clicks "Reset", the timer should be reset to 5 minutes again
